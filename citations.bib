  abstract={Older adults visit their dentists at the lowest rate of any age group. Regular dental visits appear to peak in mid-life and then decline dramatically by age 65. This qualitative study sought to understand the barriers, facilitators, and misconceptions that affect the utilization of dental health services among older adults. The results of this study, which involved 12 senior center participants, found distinct misconceptions, barriers, and facilitators to accessing dental health care. Misconceptions were especially prevalent among participants with total tooth loss, but also included participants whose outlook toward dental care use was misguided. Barriers to dental care included costs of dental care, as well as ineffective office procedures to manage appointments. On the other hand, some dental office procedures were found to be helpful and would be considered facilitators to dental care. Other facilitators were “lay consultants” who assist participants in accessing dental services, as well as dental providers whose educational efforts are consistent with the needs of the patients. Implications highlight potential interventions to create better access to dental care for older adults.},

  abstract={Doc number: 245 Abstract Background: Severe untreated dental decay affects a child's growth, body weight, quality of life as well as cognitive development, and the effects extend beyond the child to the family, the community and the health care system. Early health behavioural factors, including dietary practices and eating patterns, can play a major role in the initiation and development of oral diseases, particularly dental caries. The parent/caregiver, usually the mother, has a critical role in the adoption of protective health care behaviours and parental feeding practices strongly influence children's eating behaviours. This study will test if an early oral health promotion intervention through the use of brief motivational interviewing (MI) and anticipatory guidance (AG) approaches can reduce the incidence of early childhood dental decay and obesity. Methods: The study will be a randomised controlled study with parents and their new-born child/ren who are seen at 6-12 weeks of age by a child/community health nurse. Consenting parents will complete a questionnaire on oral health knowledge, behaviours, self-efficacy, oral health fatalism, parenting stress, prenatal and peri-natal health and socio-demographic factors at study commencement and at 12 and 36 months. Each child-parent pair will be allocated to an intervention or a standard care group, using a computer-generated random blocks. The standard group will be managed through the standard early oral health screening program; "lift the lip". The intervention group will be provided with tailored oral health counselling by oral health consultants trained in MI and AG. Participating children will be examined at 24, and 36 months for the occurrence of dental decay and have their height and weight recorded. Dietary information obtained from a food frequency chart will be used to determine food and dietary patterns. Data analysis will use intention to treat and per protocol analysis and will use tests of independent proportions and means. Multivariate statistical tests will also be used to take account of socio-economic and demographic factors in addition to parental knowledge, behaviour, self-efficacy, and parent/child stress. Discussion: The study will test the effects of an oral health promotion intervention to affect oral health and general health and have the potential to demonstrate the "common risk factor" approach to health promotion.

We tested a path model with data collected from 2 waves of telephone surveys (baseline, 2009-2010; follow-up, 2011) of individuals residing in 36 rural census tracts in northern Florida (final sample size n = 1799). Higher levels of health literacy were associated with better self-rated oral health status (B = 0.091; P < .001). In addition, higher levels of health literacy were associated with better patient-dentist communication, which in turn corresponded with patterns of regular dental care and better self-rated oral health (B=0.003; P=.01). Our study showed that, beyond the often-reported effects of gender, race, education, financial status, and access to dental care, it is also important to consider the influence of health literacy and quality of patient-dentist communication on oral health status.

Higher OHL was associated with better OHS (for a 10-unit REALD increase: multivariate prevalence ratio=1.29; 95% confidence interval=1.08, 1.54). OHL was not correlated with DN, but self-efficacy showed a strong negative correlation with DN. Self-efficacy remained significantly associated with DN in a fully adjusted model that included OHL. Increased OHL was associated with better OHS but not with DN. Self-efficacy was a strong correlate of DN and may mediate the effects of literacy on OHS.},

MethodData from two National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (2005–2008) were utilized (n=10214). Dental health was assessed using the Oral Health Questionnaire (OHQ). Depression was measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), where cases were identified using a cut off score of 10 or above. Logistic regression was applied to measure magnitude of associations, controlling for a range of covariates including CRP and BMI. ResultsAfter adjustment for covariates, a significant dose–response relationship between number of oral health conditions and likelihood of PHQ-9 defined depression was observed. Compared with individuals without an oral health condition, adjusted odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for depression in those with two, four and six conditions were 1.60 (1.08–2.38), 2.13 (1.46–3.11) and 3.94 (2.72–5.72), respectively. Level of CRP and being underweight or obese were associated with being depressed.

abstract = {Objective: The present study tested the hypotheses that: (a) a dental intervention designed to promote dental care competence in an autonomy-supportive way, relative to standard care, would positively predict perceived clinician autonomy support and patient autonomous motivation for the project, increases in autonomous motivation for dental home care, perceived dental competence, and dental behaviors, and decreases in both dental plaque and gingivitis over 5.5 months; and (b) the self-determination theory process model with the intervention and individual differences in autonomy orientation positively predicting project autonomous motivation and increases in perceived dental competence, both of which would be associated with increases in dental behavior, which would, in turn, lead to decreased plaque and gingivitis. Methods: A randomized two-group experiment was conducted at a dental clinic with 141 patients ( M age = 23.31 years, SD = 3.5), with pre- and postmeasures (after 5.5 months) of motivation variables, dental behaviors, dental plaque, and gingivitis. Results: Overall, the experimental and hypothesized process models received strong support. The effect sizes were moderate for dental behavior, large for autonomous motivation for the project and perceived competence, and very large for perceived autonomy support, dental plaque, and gingivitis. A structural equation model supported the hypothesized process model. Conclusions: Considering the very large effects on reductions in dental plaque and gingivitis, promoting dental care competence in an autonomy-supportive way, relative to standard care, has important practical implications for dental treatment, home care, and health.},

To evaluate the relationship of urease with dental plaque microbial profiles in children as it relates to dental caries, and to identify the main contributors to this activity.82 supragingival plaque samples were collected from 44 children at baseline and one year later, as part of a longitudinal study on urease and caries in children. DNA was extracted; the V3-V5 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified and sequenced using 454 pyrosequencing. Urease activity was measured using a spectrophotometric assay. Data were analyzed with Qiime.Plaque urease activity was significantly associated with the composition of the microbial communities of the dental plaque (Baseline P = 0.027, One Year P = 0.012). The bacterial taxa whose proportion in dental plaque exhibited significant variation by plaque urease levels in both visits were the family Pasteurellaceae (Baseline P<0.001; One Year P = 0.0148), especially Haemophilus parainfluenzae. No association was observed between these bacteria and dental caries. Bacteria in the genus Leptotrichia were negatively associated with urease and positively associated with dental caries (Bonferroni P<0.001).Alkali production by urease enzymes primarily from species in the family Pasteurellaceae can be an important ecological determinant in children's dental plaque. Further studies are needed to establish the role of urease-associated bacteria in the acid/base homeostasis of the dental plaque, and in the development and prediction of dental caries in children.</p>},

The one-dimensional time-dependent model integrates existing knowledge on biofilm processes (mass transfer, microbial composition, microbial conversions and substrate availability) with tooth demineralisation kinetics. This work is based on the pioneering studies of Dibdin who, nearly two decades ago, build a mathematical model roughly describing the metabolic processes taking place in dental plaque. We extended Dibdin's model with: multiple microbial species (aciduric and non-aciduric Streptococci, Actinomyces and Veillonella), more metabolic processes (i.e., aerobic and anaerobic glucose conversion, low and high glucose uptake affinity pathways, formation and consumption of storage compounds), ion transport by Nernst-Planck equations, and we coupled the obtained pH and chemical component gradients inside the plaque with tooth demineralisation. The new model implementation was complemented with faster and more rigorous numerical methods for the model solution. Model results confirm the protective effect of Veillonella due to lactate consumption. Interestingly, on short term, the storage compounds may not necessarily have a negative effect on demineralisation. Individual feeding patterns can also be easily studied with this model. For example, slow ("social") consumption of sugar-containing drinks proves to be more harmful than drinking the same amount over a short period of time.

Accumulation of dental plaque and bacterial colonisation of the oropharynx is associated with a number of systemic diseases including ventilator associated pneumonia. Research methodology/design Data were collected from mechanically ventilated critically ill adults ( n = 137), enrolled within 24 hours of intubation. Dental plaque, counts of decayed, missing and filled teeth and systemic antibiotic use was assessed on study days 1, 3, 5 and 7. Dental plaque averages per study day, tooth type and tooth location were analysed. Setting Medical respiratory, surgical trauma and neuroscience ICU's of a large tertiary care centre in the southeast United States. Results Plaque: all surfaces >60% plaque coverage from day 1 to day 7; molars and premolars contained greatest plaque average >70%. Systemic antibiotic use on day 1 had no significant effect on plaque accumulation on day 3 ( p = 0.73). Conclusions Patients arrive in critical care units with preexisting oral hygiene issues. Dental plaque tends to accumulate in the posterior teeth (molars and premolars) that may be hard for nurses to visualise and reach; this problem may be exacerbated by endotracheal tubes and other equipment. Knowing accumulation trends of plaque will guide the development of effective oral care protocols.},

abstract = {<p>OBJECTIVES:Studies on dental plaque removal by chewing an apple are scarce and dated, with conflicting findings. This study aimed to determine whether chewing an apple produced mechanical removal of dental plaque or had any effect on salivary bacterial viability. METHODS:The study group consisted of 20 healthy adults with good oral health status who were randomly assigned to brush their teeth or eat an apple. After 2 weeks, the experiment was repeated with the order reversed. Plaque index (PI) and the bacterial viability (BV) in a sample of whole saliva (spit) were determined before brushing or apple eating (baseline, B), immediately afterward (A) and 24 hours afterward (24). RESULTS:After chewing an apple, PI-A was significantly higher than both PI-B (P < .001) and PI-24 (P < .001). BV-A was significantly lower than BV-B (P < .001), with a return to baseline values at the BV-24 measurement. CONCLUSIONS:Chewing an apple does not remove dental plaque, and may favor plaque regrowth during the first 24 hours, but it does produce an immediate reduction in salivary bacterial viability similar to that after tooth brushing.</p>},

abstract = {BackgroundEffective oral hygiene has been proposed as a key factor in the reduction of dental plaque colonisation and subsequent development of ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP). Listerine® oral rinse, while used extensively in dental practice has rarely been tested in mechanically ventilated patients. Sodium bicarbonate as an oral rinse has been more commonly utilised in oral hygiene regimens in intensive care patients. AimTo test the efficacies of the essential oil mouth rinse, Listerine® (Pfizer) and sodium bicarbonate in the reduction of dental plaque colonisation with respiratory pathogens and the subsequent development of VAP. MethodsThe study design was a prospective, single blind randomised comparative study of adult patients mechanically ventilated for at least 4 days. Patients were randomised to Listerine® (Pfizer) oral rinse twice daily, sodium bicarbonate oral rinse 2/24 or sterile water 2/24 (control group). All groups received tooth brushing 3 times a day. Dental plaque colonisation (primary outcome) and incidence of ventilator associated pneumonia (secondary outcome) were studied. ResultsThree hundred and ninety-eight patients were randomised to either the Listerine group (127), sodium bicarbonate group (133) or the control group (138). Baseline characteristics were similar for all groups. There were no significant differences between the control and study groups in colonisation of dental plaque at Day 4 (p=0.243). Ventilator associated pneumonia was diagnosed in 18 patients. The incidence was, Listerine® group 4.7%, sodium bicarbonate group 4.5% and control 4.3% [OR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.31 to 3.16; p=0.92]. ConclusionsCompared to the control group, Listerine® or sodium bicarbonate oral rinses were not more effective in the reduction of colonisation of dental plaque or the incidence of VAP. Given the low incidence of VAP, the common factor of a small, soft toothbrush as part of an oral hygiene regimen suggests possible benefit in mechanically ventilated patients.},

abstract = {<p>Dental decay is one of the most prevalent chronic diseases worldwide. A variety of factors, including microbial, genetic, immunological, behavioral and environmental, interact to contribute to dental caries onset and development. Previous studies focused on the microbial basis for dental caries have identified species associated with both dental health and disease. The purpose of the current study was to improve our knowledge of the microbial species involved in dental caries and health by performing a comprehensive 16S rDNA profiling of the dental plaque microbiome of both caries-free and caries-active subjects. Analysis of over 50,000 nearly full-length 16S rDNA clones allowed the identification of 1,372 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in the dental plaque microbiome. Approximately half of the OTUs were common to both caries-free and caries-active microbiomes and present at similar abundance. The majority of differences in OTU's reflected very low abundance phylotypes. This survey allowed us to define the population structure of the dental plaque microbiome and to identify the microbial signatures associated with dental health and disease. The deep profiling of dental plaque allowed the identification of 87 phylotypes that are over-represented in either caries-free or caries-active subjects. Among these signatures, those associated with dental health outnumbered those associated with dental caries by nearly two-fold. A comparison of this data to other published studies indicate significant heterogeneity in study outcomes and suggest that novel approaches may be required to further define the signatures of dental caries onset and progression.</p>},

abstract = {More than 600 bacterial species have been identified in the oral cavity, but only a limited number of species show a strong association with periodontitis. The purpose of the present study was to provide a comprehensive outline of the microbiota in dental plaque related to periodontal status. Dental plaque from 90 subjects was sampled, and the subjects were clustered based on bacterial composition using the terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism of 16S rRNA genes. Here, we evaluated (1) periodontal clinical parameters between clusters; (2) the correlation of subgingival bacterial composition with supragingival bacterial composition; and (3) the association between bacterial interspecies in dental plaque using a graphical Gaussian model. Cluster 1 (C1) having high prevalence of pathogenic bacteria in subgingival plaque showed increasing values of the parameters. The values of the parameters in Cluster 2a (C2a) having high prevalence of non-pathogenic bacteria were markedly lower than those in C1. A cluster having low prevalence of non-pathogenic bacteria in supragingival plaque showed increasing values of the parameters. The bacterial patterns between subgingival plaque and supragingival plaque were significantly correlated. Chief pathogens, such as Porphyromonas gingivalis , formed a network with other pathogenic species in C1, whereas a network of non-pathogenic species, such as Rothia sp. and Lautropia sp., tended to compete with a network of pathogenic species in C2a. Periodontal status relates to non-pathogenic species as well as to pathogenic species, suggesting that the bacterial interspecies connection affects dental plaque virulence.},

J Periodont Res 2012; 47: 188–197. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S To ascertain whether interdental cleaning behaviours of Australian adults were associated with lower levels of plaque, gingivitis and periodontal disease. Data were obtained from the National Survey of Adult Oral Health 2004–06. Outcome variables were three indicators of oral hygiene outcomes (the presence or not of dental plaque, dental calculus and gingivitis) and two of periodontal disease (the presence or not of at least one tooth with a periodontal pocket or clinical attachment loss of ≥ 4 mm). The independent variable was classified into the following three groups: regularly clean interproximally ‘at least daily’ (daily+); ‘less than daily’ (< daily); and ‘do not regularly clean interproximally’ (reference group). Poisson regression with robust variance estimation was used to calculate prevalence ratios (PRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) relative to the reference group, adjusted for covariates. Regular self interdental cleaning was associated with less dental plaque (< daily, PR = 0.89, 95% CI = 0.84, 0.95; and daily+, PR = 0.89, 95% CI = 0.82, 0.96), less dental calculus (< daily, PR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.80, 0.97; and daily+, PR = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.70, 0.89) and lower levels of moderate/severe gingivitis (daily+, PR = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.77, 0.94). Periodontal pocketing was less likely for the < daily group (PR = 0.61, 95% CI = 0.46, 0.82), but was not associated with daily+ cleaning (PR = 0.99, 95% CI = 0.663, 1.49). There was not a significant association between interdental cleaning and clinical attachment loss (< daily, PR = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.77, 1.05; and daily+, PR = 1.17, 95% CI = 0.95, 1.44).

(B and C) two aspects showing the brush-like shape of the stick used for teeth cleaning. Ethnopharmacological relevanceSalvadora persica shrub has been used traditionally in folk medicine for different medical condition treatments. The habitual use of Salvadora persica roots (chewing sticks) for dental hygiene is still wildly spread throughout parts of Asia, Africa, and Middle. It is one of the most important species with its reported strong antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral effects. Mechanical removal of dental plaque is regarded as an effective mean of controlling progression of periodontal disease. Aim of the studyTo evaluate the effect of active and inactive miswak on dental plaque, subgingival microbiota and gingival inflammation in patients with gingivitis. Materials and methodsIn this double blinded randomized controlled trial 68 gingivitis patients were randomly assigned to either active or inactive miswak group, and were instructed to use only issued miswaks for oral hygiene during 3 weeks experimental period. Registration of plaque, gingival inflammation, and plaque samples were taken at baseline and on completion of the study. Plaque samples were analyzed by DNA–DNA hybridization technique. ResultsActive miswak significantly reduced dental plaque (p=0.007). There were no differences between active and inactive miswak in reduction of approximal plaque and composition of subgingival microbiota. ConclusionsMiswak has an overall effect on dental plaque and gingival inflammation scores. Similar results were achieved by active and inactive miswak in difficult to reach areas, indicating miswak has limited chemical effects on this study population. Therefore, miswak can be used as a dental hygiene method in conjunction with interproximal cleaning aides.},

abstract = {BackgroundStudies investigating the role of dental plaque in oral disease have focused primarily on the quantity and quality of plaque at a given point in time. No large-scale epidemiologic research has been conducted regarding the continuity and change in plaque levels across the long term and the association of plaque levels with oral health. MethodsThe authors used data from the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study. Collection of dental plaque data occurred at ages 5, 9, 15, 18, 26 and 32 years by means of the Simplified Oral Hygiene Index. The authors assessed oral health outcomes when participants were aged 32 years. ResultsThe authors identified three plaque trajectory groups (high, n = 357; medium, n = 450; and low; n = 104) and found substantial, statistically significant differences in both caries and periodontal disease experience among those groups. For example, after the authors controlled for sex, socioeconomic status and dental visiting pattern, they found that participants in the high-plaque-trajectory group lost nearly five times more teeth owing to caries than did those in the low-plaque-trajectory group. ConclusionsAcross the long term, participants in the high-plaque-trajectory group were more likely to experience caries, periodontal disease and subsequent tooth loss than were those in the low- or medium-plaque-trajectory groups, and they experienced all those conditions with greater severity. Clinical ImplicationsImproving oral health requires emphasizing long-term self-care, as well as providing broad public health and health promotion measures that promote and support oral self-care. This study's findings suggest that poor oral hygiene and smoking have a synergistic effect on periodontal disease experience.},

Methods: A crossover, double-blind, randomized and placebo-controlled clinical trial was performed with 26 volunteers. The study was divided into four periods. During periods 2 and 4, the volunteers ingested yogurt containing probiotic or control yogurt daily for 2 weeks. Periods 1 and 3 were a 1-week run-in period and 4-week washout period, respectively. Saliva and dental plaque samples were collected from each participant at the end of each period. Mutans streptococci, lactobacilli, and total cultivable microorganisms were counted. Values were compared between groups and across periods with the Wilcoxon's test. Results: There was no difference between the yogurt containing probiotic and the control yogurt for any of the studied variables (all p > 0.05). A reduction in counts of total cultivable microorganisms was observed in dental plaque samples after ingestion of either yogurts (both p < 0.05 vs. baseline), but not in saliva (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Daily ingestion of yogurt with or without B. animalis subsp. lactis for a period of 2 weeks was beneficial in reducing total microbial counts in dental plaque. Therefore, no additional benefits were achieved by the use of the tested probiotic strain. </p>},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate the applicability of laser-induced autofluorescence (LIAF) spectroscopy to detect and quantify dental plaque. LIAF spectra were recorded in situ from dental plaque (0–3 grades of plaque index) in 300 patients with 404 nm diode laser excitation. The fluorescence intensity ratio of the emission peaks was calculated from the LIAF spectral data following which their scatter plots were drawn and the area under the receiver operating characteristics were calculated. The LIAF spectrum of clinically invisible grade-1 plaque showed a prominent emission peak at 510 nm with a satellite peak around 630 nm in contrast to grade 0 that has a single peak around 500 nm. The fluorescence intensity ratio (F510/F630) has a decreasing trend with increase in plaque grade and the ratio values show statistically significant differences (p<0.01) between different grades. An overall sensitivity and specificity of 100% each was achieved for discrimination between grade-0 and grade-1 plaque. The clinical significance of this study is that the diagnostic algorithm developed based on fluorescence spectral intensity ratio (F510/F630) would be useful to precisely identify minute amounts of plaque without the need for disclosing solutions and to convince patients of the need for proper oral hygiene and homecare practices.},

This study was conducted after ethics committee approval and written consent from guardians (and assent from the children) were obtained. A total of 1431 students in the age group 8-12 years, belonging to classes fourth to seventh, were the subjects for this study. The Knowledge, Attitude and Practice (KAP) of the subjects was determined using a questionnaire. The students were divided into three groups namely, Group I (n = 457) using Triphala mouthwash (0.6%), Group II (n = 440) using Chlorhexidine mouthwash (0.1%) (positive control), and Group III (n = 412) using distilled water (negative control). The assessment was carried out on the basis of plaque scores, gingival scores, and the microbiological analysis (Streptococcus and lactobacilli counts). Statistical analysis for plaque and gingival scores was conducted using the paired sample t-test (for intragroup) and the Tukey′s test (for intergroup conducted along with analysis of variance test). For the Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus counts, Wilcoxon and Mann-Whitney test were applied for intragroup and intergroup comparison, respectively. All the tests were carried out using the SPSS software. Both the Group I and Group II showed progressive decrease in plaque scores from baseline to the end of 9 months; however, for Group III increase in plaque scores from the baseline to the end of 9 months was noted. Both Group I and Group II showed similar effect on gingival health. There was inhibitory effect on microbial counts except Lactobacillus where Triphala had shown better results than Chlorhexidine. It was concluded that there was no significant difference between the Triphala and the Chlorhexidine mouthwash.},

Materials and methods An electronic search for clinical studies of NCCMs was conducted in Medline-PubMed, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and EMBASE for a period spanning from the earliest available date in each database up to February 2013. Plaque index, gingival index, and gingival bleeding index were selected as primary outcomes. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed according to the "Levels of Evidence" outlined by the Center of Evidence-Based Medicine, and to the Jadad scale. Results The screen yielded 2,236 titles and abstracts that met the inclusion criteria. These identified 11 clinical trials testing 13 different NCCMs, and were used for data extraction. Heterogeneity and the limited number of studies on any individual NCCM precluded a formal meta-analysis. Of the 13 NCCMs tested, eight demonstrated positive results, and few reported any adverse effects or events. Conclusions Evidence proving the effectiveness of NCCM as an adjunct to unsupervised oral hygiene for plaque and gingivitis control is still insufficient. However, some natural products (compounds) may have oral health benefits, so further high-quality study is warranted. Clinical relevance This review provides an overview of the strength of clinical evidence regarding the effectiveness of natural compounds containing mouthrinses in promoting gingival health.

METHODS: 68 students (34 with caries and 34 caries-free) aged 17–20 years from a private dental college, Moradabad city, who agreed to refrain from oral hygiene procedures for 48 hours were selected for the study. Calcium and phosphorus levels of harvested dental plaque were measured using an electrolyte analyser while plaque pH was measured using a digital pH meter after consuming different dairy products (cheese, milk, yogurt) and compared with the control (paraffin) group. RESULTS: Cheese and yogurt groups showed a statistically significant rise in mean plaque concentrations of calcium and phosphorus, whereas milk and control groups showed the least rise in plaque concentrations for both caries-active and caries-free subjects. Plaque pH showed a stronger correlation with plaque calcium and phosphorus concentrations in both caries-active and caries-free subjects. CONCLUSION: Cheese and yogurt without any added sugar (sucrose) are non-cariogenic and to some extent cariostatic as they increase calcium and phosphorus concentration in dental plaque. Dairy products without added sugar can be recommended as after meal desserts, especially to school children, which would help to reduce the incidence of dental caries.},

abstract = {ObjectivesThe aim of this study was to determine whether measurements of volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) are useful to predict colonization of periodontopathic bacteria. For this purpose, we assessed the relationships among distributions of 4 species of periodontopathic bacteria in tongue coating and dental plaque, oral conditions including VSC concentration in mouth air, and smoking habit of periodontal healthy young subjects. MethodsThe subjects were 108 young adults (mean age, 23.5±2.56 years) without clinical periodontal pockets. Information regarding smoking habit was obtained by interview. After VSC concentration in mouth, air was measured with a portable sulfide monitor (Halimeter®), non-stimulated saliva flow and dental caries status were assessed, and tongue coating and dental plaque samples were collected from the subjects. The tongue coating samples were weighed to determine the amount. The colonization of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, Prevotella intermedia, and Treponema denticola in both tongue coating and plaque samples was investigated using species-specific polymerase chain reaction assays. ResultsSignificant relationships were observed between the colonization of periodontopathic bacteria in tongue coating and plaque samples, especially that of P. gingivalis. VSC concentration showed the most significant association with colonization of P. gingivalis in both tongue coating and dental plaque. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the adjusted partial correlation coefficient [Exp(B)] values for VSC concentration with the colonization of P. gingivalis, P. intermedia, and T. denticola in dental plaque were 135, 35.4 and 10.4, respectively. In addition, smoking habit was also shown to be a significant variable in regression models [Exp(B)=6.19, 8.92 and 2.53, respectively]. Therefore, receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed to predict the colonization of periodontal bacteria in dental plaque in the subjects divided by smoking habit. Based on our results, we found cut-off values that indicated likelihood ratios (LR) within the efficient range for positive findings in both groups. ConclusionThe present results demonstrated that measurement of VSC concentration in mouth air is a useful method to predict the presence of colonization of some periodontopathic bacteria in dental plaque.},

abstract = {<p> Objective The natural accumulation of supragingival plaque on surfaces of human teeth is associated with gingival inflammation and the initiation of common oral diseases. This study evaluated the distribution of dental plaque and gingivitis scores within the dental arches after prophylaxis. Methods Adult subjects from the Dharwad, India area representing the general population who provided written informed consent were scheduled for screening. Healthy subjects over the age of 18 years, not currently requiring any medical or dental care, and presenting with a complement of at least 20 natural teeth were recruited for this parallel design study. Enrolled subjects (n = 41) underwent oral examinations for dental plaque (PI) and gingivitis (GI) using the Turesky modification of the Quigley-Hein and the Löe-Silness Index, respectively, at the baseline visit, followed by a whole mouth dental prophylaxis. Subjects were given fluoride toothpaste for twice daily oral hygiene for the next 30 days. Subjects were recalled on days 15 and 30 for PI and GI examinations identical to baseline. Results Analyses indicated that mean scores for PI and GI on either arch and the whole mouth were higher than 2 and 1, respectively, during all examinations. Anterior surfaces consistently exhibited lower PI scores than posterior regions of either arch, or the entire dentition. Regional GI differences within the dentition were similar to PI scores, with lower scores on anterior than posterior teeth. Prophylaxis reduced both the frequency and mean scores of both PI and GI, irrespective of arch, with lower scores observed on anterior than posterior regions during all recall visits. Molar and lingual regions consistently exhibited higher PI and GI scores compared with anterior surfaces. At all examinations, mean scores for both plaque and gingivitis were higher on approximal vestibular than mid-vestibular surfaces. Conclusions Differences observed in PI and GI within the dentition have several practical implications: (a) there are advantages of whole mouth assessments for oral health (b) a need for oral hygiene formulations to reduce the larger deposits of dental plaque in the posterior region and resultant gingival inflammation, and (c) a requirement for ongoing oral hygiene education. </p>},

abstract = {<p>Currently, the normal microflora is considered to be the open biocenosis of the microorganisms occurring in a healthy host organism. This biocenosis is physiological and helps to maintain the healthy status of the body, as well as its proper physiological functioning. However, reducing the body resistance may initiate the complications caused by the microbiocenoses representatives in the course of various human diseases. The representatives of microbiocenoses themselves become the etiological factor of disease state, including dental caries and periodontal diseases. Considering the high prevalence of the mentioned pathologies among the human representatives, they become of the great social significance. Particularly, at the present stage of human development, the ambiguity in the microflora functionality causes its multiple evaluations in medical specialists and representatives of other fields of science. The controversial and unclear aspects in the study of microbiocenoses, as well as the unexplored gaps in this field make it relevant to conduct the further research of biotopes. The microflora species composition of the oral cavity varies throughout the life of the individual. The primary penetration of bacteria into the oral cavity occurs when the fetus passes through the birth canal. The initial microflora is already replaced on 2-7 day by bacteria living in the oral cavity of mother and maternity unit staff. During the first months of life, aerobes and facultative anaerobes predominate in the oral cavity of the child. It is explained by the absence of the teeth rows in babies, necessary for obligate anaerobes existence. Teeth eruption causes the sharp changing in the qualitative composition of microorganisms characterized by the appearance and rapid increase in the number of obligate anaerobes. At the same time, the distribution of microorganisms and colonization of the oral cavity according to the anatomical features of the certain biotopes occur. In this case, the numerous microsystems with the relatively stable microbiocenoses are formed. Spirochetes and bacteroids appear in the oral cavity only nearly 14 years of age, which is associated with the age-related changes in the body endocrine profile. The human immune system becomes mature by this time. During this period, the risk of gingivitis and various types of stomatitis increases. The changes in the oral cavity microflora of adults occur either in case of dental diseases, or as a result of the teeth loss and their replacement with the dental prostheses, or in systemic diseases accompanied by disbacteriosis. Considering the above mentioned, it can be noted that the role of the biotopes links inside the host organism and between them is underestimated and poorly studied, although it should greatly influence on the relations between the structure and functioning of the body in normal and pathological conditions. Therefore, it can be assumed that the primary aim of the biotopes study is the functioning investigation, which is changing due to the ecological transformations, and also affects the organism morphology and its changes. In turn, determining the functional links between the biotopes representatives provides the new methods and means implementation influencing microbioms.</p>},

Periodontal diseases are one of the most prevalent oral diseases affecting more than 50% of Indian community. Materials and Method: A two months randomised controlled trial was conducted among ninety school children aged between 13 and 15 years, from a hostel located in Davangere city. The 90 study subjects who fulfilled inclusion and exclusion criteria were randomly divided into 3 groups namely Placebo, Chlorhexidine and Probiotic groups. Plaque scores were recorded at baseline (0 day), on 15 th day (after 14 days of intervention) and 3 weeks (after discontinuation of intervention). Statistical analysis was done using one way ANOVA and paired ′t′ test and P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: There was no statistically significant difference between groups at baseline. On 15 th day and after 3 weeks, plaque scores were significantly higher in placebo group compared to probiotic group. On 15 th day and after 3 weeks, plaque scores were higher in chlorhexidine group compared to probiotic group but difference was not statistically significant. Conclusion: Probiotic mouth rinse was more effective for inhibition of dental plaque accumulation after 14 days of intervention and also after 3 weeks of discontinuation of intervention.</p>},

abstract = {<p> Objective: To detect changes in the microbial richness of dental plaque and oral behaviors during caries development in young Chinese children. Methods: Supragingival plaque samples and a survey of oral behaviors of 130 children aged 3 at baseline were analyzed at 6 months and 12 months. Total DNA was isolated from all samples and PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis was conducted. Results: In the follow-up, 44 children had caries or cavity fillings at 6 months, a further 28 children had caries or cavity fillings at 12 months. The other 58 children remained caries-free at 12 months. According to the changes in caries status at the 12-month follow-up, all participants were divided into three groups: caries-free, caries at 6 months and caries at 12 months. The changes in oral behaviors during the 12-month follow-up were not significantly different in the three groups. The frequency of eating sweets and eating sweets before sleeping was significantly different among the three groups at baseline. At baseline, the average detectable bands of caries in the 12-month caries group were similar to those of the caries-free group; both of them were higher than that of the 6-month caries group. At 6 months, the average detectable bands of the 12-month caries group were significantly lower than that of the caries-free group although the children of the 12-month caries group were caries-free at that time. Conclusions: For young Chinese children, the high frequency of eating sweets and eating sweets before sleeping are risk factors of caries onset, and the decrease in microbial richness could occur 6 months before the onset of caries. </p>},

abstract = {<p> Aim: We aimed to assess caries experience and microbiota in systemically healthy children with black stain (BS) and non-discoloured plaque. Methods: Forty-six children with BS and 47 counterparts with non-discoloured plaque aged 7.9 ± 1.3 years were clinically examined. Dental caries was scored using WHO criteria. Samples of BS and non-discoloured dental plaque were collected from tooth surfaces. The DNA of the samples was extracted and real-time PCR was performed to determine the total number of bacteria and the species Streptococcus mutans, S. sobrinus, Lactobacillus sp., Actinomyces naeslundii, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and Fusobacterium nucleatum. Results: Children with BS had lower DMFT (p = 0.013), lower DT values (p = 0.005) and a tendency to lower caries prevalence (p = 0.061) than children with non-discoloured plaque. Plaque samples of the BS group contained higher numbers of A. naeslundii (p = 0.005) and lower numbers of F. nucleatum (p = 0.001) and Lactobacillus sp. (p = 0.001) compared to the non-discoloured plaque samples of the control group. Comparing the children with BS and non-discoloured plaque, higher counts for A. naeslundii (p = 0.013) were observed in caries-free children with BS while in caries-affected children with BS, lower counts of F. nucleatum (p = 0.007) were found. Counts of Lactobacillus sp. were higher in non-discoloured plaque samples than in BS of caries-free and caries-affected children. Conclusion: Results suggest that the different microbial composition of BS might be associated with the lower caries experience in affected subjects. The role of black-pigmented bacteria associated with periodontitis needs further studies. </p>},

Results from this study indicate that most subjects (97%) utilized a toothbrush and toothpaste for oral hygiene with a majority (92%) using their right hand to brush their teeth. While 29% reported two or more episodes of daily oral hygiene, a majority (53%) brushed their teeth once daily. Utilization of dental floss and mouthwashes were reported by approximately 1% of this population, and most (73%) reported no dental visits in the preceding 5 years. Whole mouth plaque and gingival scores (average ± standard deviation) for this population were 2.47 ± 0.55 and 1.19 ± 0.31, respectively, with no significant differences between either gender (P > 0.05). Significant correlations (r > 0.44) were observed between plaque and gingival scores for the entire sample, either gender or between age groups (P < 0.001). Analyses indicate that anterior teeth demonstrated lower average scores for dental plaque and gingivitis than posterior and molar regions (P < 0.05). Education was associated with higher plaque and gingival scores: plaque scores [odds ratios; 95% confidence interval; 1.23; 1.01–1.50 and gingival scores odds ratios 1.25; 1.02–1.54]. In summary, results from this study demonstrate the prevalence of dental plaque and gingivitis in the general population and their relationships with demographic characteristics. They reinforce examinations of posterior regions that consistently harbor more plaque and corresponding gingivitis in evaluations of oral health.},

abstract = {<p>Aim: To evaluate if a commercially available herbal mouthwash, can be a better choice as an anti-plaque and antigingivitis agent when compared with chlorhexidine. Materials and Methods: In a double-blind, parallel group randomized clinical trial 90 nursing students aged 18-25 years were randomly divided into three groups: A (chlorhexidine), B (HiOra) and C (distilled water). These groups were asked to rinse with their respective mouthwash two times daily for 21 days. Plaque and gingivitis were evaluated by using Turesky et al. modification of Quigley Hein Plaque Index (1970) and Modified Gingival Index by Lobene et al. (1986) respectively. Statistical analysis was done using ANOVA test. Results: There was statistically significant reduction in plaque and gingival scores from baseline to 21 days in both the groups A and B. Conclusions: Although chlorhexidine group proved to be the best anti-plaque and antigingivitis agent, it was found that HiOra group also showed gradual improvement from baseline to 21 days. Whereas no improvement was seen in the Group C using distilled water over 21 days.</p>},
