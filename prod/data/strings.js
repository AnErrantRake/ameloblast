  birth_intro: ["The year is ~~~~. Unchecked technological advancement has replaced the world's weather patterns with 'mealstorms', mana from heaven. While instantly solving world hunger, the mealstorms completely destroyed Earth's ecosystem and much of human civilization. What remains is a food-coated wasteland with only small, isolated pockets of human survivors.",
                "The knowledge of oral hygiene disappeared with civilization, leaving the oral health of the few remaining humans vulnerable to the mealstorms. Your village lies in the path of a terrible mealstorm providing only the most corrosive of foods. As the only villager with all your teeth, you stand the best chance of recovering the lost tomes of dental knowledge before all is lost."],
  birth_supplies: "Your vehicle 'ameloblast' can only carry a small number of supplies. All supplies are single use. You will need to carefully ration as you proceed. Resources can be scavenged as you go, but only at the cost of time. Make sure to take as much from your village as you can before you leave.",
  birth_behavior: "The only defense against the mealstorms is daily oral hygiene. Only dentists knew the best approach to take. You'll have to figure out the best approach through trial and error, as well as with whatever information can be gleaned from the tomes. Your village will follow the behavior you set for them here for as long as supplies last.",
  birth_tasking: ["The first generation of survivors sent scholars to find the tomes. None have returned, but their last locations are known and programmed into your vehicle. You must travel to these locations and search for the tomes, the scholars, or anything the scholars left behind. The road will be long, the mealstorms intense. Stay healthy, watch the skies, scavenge only as necessary.",
                  "It's been years since the scholars were heard from. They may not have survived. Learn what you can and move on. If you manage to catch up with all of the scholars before you succumb, take the knowledge you've gained back to your village as quickly as possible. If you move fast enough, some of your family and friends may survive. So get going."],

  death_success: ["Long you have journeyed and far you have come. You have avoided the fate of your mentor and fulfilled his last wish. While knowledge is only as useful as its application, you are now equipped with the secrets of oral hygiene. For those who practice this discipline, the mealstorms become the boon they were once intended to be.",
                  "Under your tutelage, the survivors in your village can rise from the ashes of the old world and build a civilization greater than any that has come before. A civilization where toothbrushes rain from the sky, floss grows on trees and mouthwash flows like the rivers of old."],
  death_failure: ["Was it the mealstorms? Were you too frugal? A bad start from which you could never recover? Perhaps it was mere chance. No matter the cause, your fate is sealed.",
                  "Perhaps another can find a way to restore what was lost?"],
